This repo involves predicting human movement using data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

The original dataset can be found here:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The repo also features files for a web app created using Streamlit. The .pkl file used for creating new predictions was generated using PyCaret.
The data_unseen file is a portion of data not used in modelling but which has been referenced for forming new predictions in the app.
See requirements.txt for more details.
